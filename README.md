# LaTex-LabReport-Template

This LaTeX Report Template includes both Chinese and English versions.At frist, this repository is for students in Nanjing University of Sci & Tech(NJUST) to write experimental reports more efficiently.

Since my girlfriend became a student in National University of Singapore (Suzhou) Research Institute (NUSRI), she may need an English report template to finish her coursework. So I modified the original Chinese version to complete the English version. Although it is designed for students in NUSRI, it can also be used for students from other universities, just replace the figure on the cover with what you need.

## Features
Here are a few features of this template.
 * support both Chinese and English 
 * support simple title page
 * support abstract and contents
 * support custom header
 * support native MATLAB code style

## Some issues to know
* Make sure you have installed LaTeX.
* Using the Book Antiqua font and Book Antiqua Bold font in the English template, make sure your system has installed this font. This font is so elegant that I set it as mainfont of the English template. (ps: If you need them, you can find them in the font folder.)

## Using
 * If you want the Chinese version, pls run ``xelatex LabReport_Ch.tex``. 
 * If you want the English version, pls run ``xelatex LabReport_En.tex``.

## Screenshots
Only two covers of two templates are provided here. If you want to see more details, pls download the LabReport_Ch.pdf file and the LabReport_En.pdf file.
